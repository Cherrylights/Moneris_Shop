<h2>Agreement and Payment</h2><p>The online presentation of the Site?s goods, as well as the corresponding prices do not constitute a binding offer by the Site Owner and are subject to change. It is your order of goods via the Site which constitutes such a binding offer to enter into an agreement over the sale of said goods. When an order has been processed on the Site, the Site Owner will confirm receipt of your order electronically. Note that this confirmation of receipt does not constitute an acceptance of your offer to enter into an agreement over the sale of the Site?s goods.</p><p>Acceptance of your offer shall take place only if the Site Owner provides you with an order confirmation in writing or by email for the goods confirmed therein, or, in the alternative, upon delivery of goods. If your order is incorrect you must&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.moneris.com/en/contacts/">contact us</a>&nbsp;within 10 business days of your order to correct the sale.</p><p>All invoices are issued in Canadian dollars.</p><h4>Accepted Payment Methods</h4><p>The Site accepts the following credit card types: Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.</p><h4>Credit Card Charges</h4><p>Your credit card will be charged immediately after you placed your order. If the Site Owner is not able to fulfill your order for any reason, your credit card will be refunded.</p><h4><a name="secure" class="page-anchor">Secure Shopping</a></h4><p>All of the Site?s transactions are processed over a secure connection, ensuring full protection of your personal information. All credit card details are captured over a secure 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL). This SSL certificate indicates that a third party has verified the identity of the Site's Owner and set up an encrypted line of communication between you and the Site. This means that your credit card number is automatically transferred as part of the transaction process and, unlike a traditional store, no human ever comes into contact with your card number during the approval process. Furthermore, the Site never stores your credit card information.</p><p>Each transaction requires you to provide the Card Verification Value (CVV) of your credit card. A CVV is a 3-4 digit code located on all current credit cards and is used as additional verification to ensure that the cardholder is in possession of the credit card being used.</p><p>If you have any concerns about the security of the Site, please contact us.</p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Orders</h2><h4>Order Tracking</h4><p>If a tracking number is provided by the shipping carrier, the Site Owner will update your order with the tracking information. Note that some orders may not include tracking numbers. You may also check the status of your order by logging into your&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.moneris.com/en/customer/account/login/">customer account</a>.</p><h4>Out of Stock Items</h4><p>The Site Owner strives to ensure that every item displayed on the Site is available and in stock. However, should an order be processed for an item that is not available, you will be contacted by email and refunded the total amount of your order through your original payment method.</p><h4>Back Orders</h4><p>Due to high demand, some items may not be in stock at the time you place your order. In this case, you will be notified and the item you have ordered will be placed on backorder and delivered to you upon receipt of the stock as well as upon receipt of the payment. Stock on backorder is not subject to an additional delivery charge.</p><hr><h2><a name="shipping" class="page-anchor">Shipping</a></h2><p>The Site Owner currently ships with competitive rates and reasonable delivery times across Canada. Shipments outside of Canada are not available at this time.</p><h4>Calculating Cost</h4><p>Shipping costs from the Site are based on both the weight of your order as well as the delivery method. Shipping charges are based on our&nbsp;transport contractor's&nbsp;standard courier rates. To find out how much your order will cost, simply add the items you would like to purchase to your cart, and proceed to the checkout page. Once at the checkout screen, adding your shipping information will calculate your shipping cost for Standard Shipping only.</p><h4>Delivery Time</h4><p>Orders received before 4:00 PM EST are shipped on the same business day, excluding weekends and holidays.
